# Etch-a-Sketch

Hello! My name is Honk and I will be creating yet another project as suggested by The Odin Project curriculum. Once I am done I'll be discussing what I learned while working on this project.

Before starting, I feel a concerned that The Odin Project said that this will be difficult. However, I'm also excited to be programming again, and I'm eager to learn more so that soon enough I'll be able to create complete websites and applications from scratch. 


Afterthoughts - Wow, that started very easy and got very complicated near the end. Mistakes were made, recognized, and fixed, but this isn't about that. This is about what I've learned, so let's get right to it.


What I've Learned: 

Global variables are so, so important. Function not working because of scope issues with a variable? Make it global. Global variables saved me countless times.

Live Nodelists are a thing, which I did not know beforehand. They updated whenever things are added or removed from the collection and I think that's what seperates it from static Nodelists.

Nodelists can be iterated through using a for loop, like an array.

Math.ceil and Math.floor are very helpful for generating numbers within a certain range. I used them once or twice before in the past, but this project as shown me just how important those two functions can be. Without them I would not have be able to generate random colors throughout the grid.

Variables can be used for styling through JavaScript. I made variables that represent red, green, and blue to set the background color, and a variable for the opacity. I didn't know this was possible prior to this project and it was incredibly important for randomizing the background color of each grid square and changing their opacity. 

Element.replaceChildren is such a convenient way to empty out an element.

Making changes to the main branch while working on another branch is not a good idea, in my opinion. The changes made to the main branch will not apply to the new branch until they are merged. It's just confusing.

I was yet again reminded of the importance of using many, many containers when working with flexbox. More containers and more display: flex when working with flexbox solves so many unnecessary issues.


It was a struggle in areas that I did not expect, but I'm very happy with the result. However, I would like to step up my game with CSS in the future. I looked at a few other people's projects and realized I would like to do more. I just did not feel like this was the project to visually experiment with.

To anyone reading this, thank you! And if you're also an aspiring programmer good luck!
