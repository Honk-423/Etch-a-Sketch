# Etch-a-Sketch

Hello! My name is Honk and I will be creating yet another project as suggested by The Odin Project curriculum. Once I am done I'll be discussing what I learned while working on this project.

Before starting, I feel a concerned that The Odin Project said that this will be difficult. However, I'm also excited to be programming again, and I'm eager to learn more so that soon enough I'll be able to create complete websites and applications from scratch.
